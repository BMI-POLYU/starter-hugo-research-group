**Brain Machine Intelligence (BMI) Laboratory** is established at the Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University by Dr. Jibin Wu. Our lab operates at the intersection of neuroscience, psychology, machine learning, and engineering to advance our understanding of the computational principles and architectures underlying biological brains, and to design next-generation brain-inspired cognitive machines that are low-power, robust, adaptive, and explainable. In particular, we work on the following research areas:
1. **Computational Neuroscience**: Learning Algorithms for Spiking Neural Networks, Neural Coding, Brain-inspired Neural Architecture Design
2. **Computational Audition**: Human Auditory System Modelling, Neural-steered Speaker Extraction, Speech Processing
3. **Cognitive Robot**: Neuromorphic Sensing, Human-Robot Interaction, Cognitive Modelling (e.g, Memory, Emotion, Attention, and Motivation)
