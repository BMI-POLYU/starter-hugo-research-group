The **Brain Machine Intelligence (BMI) Laboratory ** at the Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

We study how people hear. Our lab operates at the intersection of psychology, neuroscience, and engineering.

Our longterm goals:

To understand the computational principles underlying human audition
To improve devices for assisting those whose hearing is impaired
To design more effective machine systems for recognizing and interpreting sound

	The Human Language Technology (HLT) Laboratory is at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore. The Lab establishes itself as the technology leader in Human-centric Artificial Intelligence (H.AI). It is known for its research in automatic speech recognition, speaker and language recognition, speech synthesis and conversion, spoken dialogue, and human-robot interaction. The laboratory undertakes industry projects and solves real-world engineering problems. It also leads major research programs in national initiatives such as Neuromorphic Computing, National Robotics Programme, and AI Singapore. The HLT team received numerous awards that include IEEE Computational Intelligence Society Outstanding TNNLS Paper Award 2016, IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine Outstanding Paper Award 2019, APSIPA ASC Best Student Paper 2017 and 2018, ISCA Fellow 2018, and 1st Prize of International Competition for Brain-inspired Computing 2018.
